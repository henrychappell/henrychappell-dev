                <p>I am a classically-trained singer, composer and musician from Surrey. I perform and compose a wide variety
                    of music, from popular to classical I am a saxophonist and play the piano, which enables me to accompany
                    myself to a number of songs. Alternatively backing tracks/other musicians are sometimes necessary depending
                    on the music. I am currently studying Music and Music Technology at the University of Nottingham, where
                    I am also the Musical Director of the A Capella group Radio Octave as well as conductor of various choirs
                    within the University's music department. In 2016 I was Assistant Musical Director of my school's production
                    of Grease, in which I conducted the band and cast for the first act of the show, as well as taking rehearsals.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am generally available for performances in the London, the south-east and East Midlands areas. I would
                    be delighted to speak to you about your event and requirements. Please do contact me for further details
                    on availability and rates. Thank you!</p>
