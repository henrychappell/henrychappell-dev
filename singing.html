                <p>I am a classically-trained baritone, having taken professional singing lessons since the age of 10. I have
                    been a member of the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain since the age of 12, and am currently a member
                    of the Main Choir. Being a member of this organisation has allowed me to perform in some of the country’s
                    best venues and occasions, most recently in the BBC’s 2018 First Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert
                    Hall, whilst elsewhere I have sung at Leeds Castle, the O2 arena and toured with choirs to France, Belgium
                    and the Czech Republic. As a soloist I have performed in numerous school and public concerts and have
                    wide experience of singing at private occasions such as funerals and weddings. I would be very happy
                    to adapt performances according to audience preference.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Below are some examples of solo pieces which are currently in my repertoire and I would be pleased to discuss
                    my full range and portfolio. I can also learn new pieces very quickly and with ease should you have specific
                    requirements.</p>
